* The code refers to the codes of the paper **Equivariant Learning of Stochastic Fields:
Gaussian Processes and Steerable Conditional Neural Processes** and **Stationary Kernels and Gaussian Processes on Lie Groups
and their Homogeneous Spaces I: the Compact Case**
* I also draw kernel defined on circle, ie. circle_kernel.py. The *.png file is the result. The code refers to the package **GeometricKernels**.
