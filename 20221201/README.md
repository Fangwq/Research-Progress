* The code refers to the codes of the paper **Equivariant Learning of Stochastic Fields:
Gaussian Processes and Steerable Conditional Neural Processes** and **Stationary Kernels and Gaussian Processes on Lie Groups
and their Homogeneous Spaces I: the Compact Case**
* I also draw kernel defined on circle, ie. circle_kernel.py. The *.png file is the result. The code refers to the package **GeometricKernels**. The file **circle_kernel2.py** is the right way and the file **circle_kernel.py** define the space in the wrong way.
* Lie_circle.py is from https://github.com/imbirik/LieStationaryKernels/issues/3, and the author gives me the right about how to use Lie group theory to 
define kernel on circle.
