# The codes are based on the github directory *UCL-Msc-Project-main*. And 
I add few codes to reproduct the results in the Mark van der Wilk's paper.
The code is both useful for the following two papers:

    Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood [1]
    Last Layer Marginal Likelihood for Learning Invariance [2]

### for regression
run the *regression.py* file

### for classification
run the *ex51_InvVaeSVGP.py* file

### for horovod framework
run the *ex51_InvVaeSVGP_horovod.py* file
