Recently, I do not spend much time on my own reseach because of loss of focus. I only read few papers about symmetry and machine learning, such as:
**Invariant polynomials and machine learning**, **Classification as Direction Recovery: Improved Guarantees via Scale Invariance**. 
It aims to treat classification problem into direction loss. I also debug the code for the paper 
**Symmetry-via-Duality: Invariant Neural Network Densities from Parameter-Space Correlators**.
