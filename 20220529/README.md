Recently, I debugged the code for the interesting paper **Geometric compression of invariant manifolds in neural nets**. And I have learned that how the parameters evolve when the symmetry is in the data. Also, it has obvios connection with the neural tangent kernel. The codes refers to its original opensourced codes.

1. the .sh file is for the run script
 
2. ntk_compare.py file check the calculation of ntk and the author's method runs very fast.
 
3. the show*.py files are for plot
